Q: Looking at the backtrace output, which function called syscall?
A: usertrap

Q: What is the value of p->trapframe->a7 and what does that value represent? (Hint: look user/initcode.S, the first user program xv6 starts.)
A: p->trapframe->a7 == 0x7, representing 'SYS_exec'.

Q: What was the previous mode that the CPU was in?
A: $sstatus == 0x22, where SPP bit == 0, meaning 'user mode'

Q: Write down the assembly instruction the kernel is panicing at. Which register corresponds to the variable num?
A: 'lw a3,0(zero)', where `a3` corresponds to `num`.

Q: Why does the kernel crash? Hint: look at figure 3-3 in the text; is address 0 mapped in the kernel address space? Is that confirmed by the value in scause above? (See description of scause in RISC-V privileged instructions)
A: virtual address at 0x00000000 is not allocate, so visiting it would create a exception. scause == 0x000000000000000d, indicating 'load page fault', confirming the above statement.

Q: What is the name of the binary that was running when the kernel paniced? What is its process id (pid)?
A: 'initcode', PID=1
